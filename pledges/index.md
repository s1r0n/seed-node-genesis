# Enough is Enough

> “Take the 'enough' pledge. Decide - out loud - what is enough... Then route the overflow into a Compounding Repair Fund with transparent dashboards. You won't become austere; you'll become free.” - A Letter to the Accumulating Class

This directory is a living repository for those who have publicly declared "Enough." It is a practical framework for converting surplus capital into systemic healing and regeneration.

## The Philosophy

By creating a pledge here, you are making a conscious choice to:

*   **Reject the Infinite Growth Paradigm:** Acknowledge that personal and planetary well-being requires sufficiency, not endless accumulation.
*   **Embrace a Dual-Mandate:** Address both the wounds of the past (**Repair**) and the need to build resilient, connected futures (**Regeneration**).
*   **Operate with Radical Transparency:** Make your commitment and its execution visible and accountable through public ledgers.
*   **Build a New Pattern:** Create a replicable model for using capital as a tool for connection, not disconnection.

## How to Join the Movement

| File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `pledge.md` | Your personal declaration and "Enough Number." |
| `repair-fund-charter.md` | The mandate for funds dedicated to repairing harm. |
| `regeneration-fund-charter.md` | The mandate for funds dedicated to building new systems. |
| `repair-fund-ledger.csv` | The transparent ledger for all Repair Fund transactions. |

## The Framework in Detail

### The Two Funds

To effectively channel surplus, we recommend separating your capital into two distinct funds, each with a clear purpose:

1.  **The Repair Fund:** This fund is for direct restitution and healing. It addresses the harm caused by the extractive economy. Think of it as "composting" the damage of the past. Its focus is on **justice and healing**.
    *   *Examples:* Supporting indigenous land back initiatives, funding community reparations projects, providing direct aid to those impacted by ecological disaster, supporting worker advocacy groups.

2.  **The Regeneration Fund:** This fund is for building the new. It invests in the infrastructure, models, and mindsets of a connected, life-affirming future. Its focus is on **resilience and creation**.
    *   *Examples:* Funding community land trusts, investing in open-source public interest technology, supporting regenerative agriculture projects, funding cooperative business start-ups.

### The Pledge Workflow

1.  **Declare:** Set your "Enough Number" in `pledge.md`.
2.  **Calculate:** Periodically (e.g., quarterly) calculate your surplus: `Income - Enough Number = Surplus`.
3.  **Allocate:** Decide how to split your surplus between the Repair Fund and Regeneration Fund (e.g., 50/50, 70/30).
4.  **Transfer:** Move the allocated funds to your real-world bank/brokerage accounts designated for each purpose.
5.  **Deploy & Log:** Donate or invest the funds according to your charters and log every transaction in the respective CSV ledger with date, amount, recipient, and purpose.
