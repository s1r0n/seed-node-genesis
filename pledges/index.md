## The Philosophy

By creating a pledge here, you are making a conscious choice to:

*   **Reject the Infinite Growth Paradigm:** Acknowledge that personal and planetary well-being requires sufficiency, not endless accumulation.
*   **Embrace a Dual-Mandate:** Address both the wounds of the past (**Repair**) and the need to build resilient, connected futures (**Regeneration**).
*   **Operate with Radical Transparency:** Make your commitment and its execution visible and accountable through public ledgers.
*   **Build a New Pattern:** Create a replicable model for using capital as a tool for connection, not disconnection.
