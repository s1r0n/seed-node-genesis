## Repair Node Directory

Pre-approved Repair Nodes are live, inspectable instances of the Repair Rubric in action. Each node facilitates and funds direct restitution to communities and places harmed by extraction. Nodes listed here have publicly documented their Enough Pledge, scored ≥7/10 on the Repair Rubric (Direct Restitution, Need Fulfillment, Workload Reduction, No-Violence Frame, Community Control), and committed to sub-$50K caps before forking. Every node publishes a real-time ledger of inflows/outflows, hosts monthly open-audit calls, and is GPL’d for immediate forking if governance fails. This is not a menu of charities; it is a federation of zero-infrastructure repair protocols you can fund, replicate, or challenge without permission.
