# The Enough is Enough Pledge

This repository hosts the "Enough is Enough" pledge—a public commitment to move from endless accumulation to conscious healing and connection. By declaring a personal income cap and routing surplus to dedicated [Repair Funds](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Repair_Fund) and [Regeneration Funds](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Repair_Fund), participants actively dismantle the growth-at-all-costs paradigm. 

Through transparent ledgers and community accountability, we're building a practical framework for economic transformation that prioritizes human and planetary well-being over perpetual expansion.

**License: GPL v3.0**  
This is not a product. It is a protocol. You cannot own it. You can only fork it, improve it, and keep it open.

## What This Repo Is
- **Code**: Allocation logic, GitHub Action scripts for auto-publishing transactions, issue templates for proposals.
- **Content**: The Repair Rubric, Enough Pledge template, audit transcripts. *All content is also GPL'd—no CC-BY dual license.* If you remix the theory, you must share alike.

## What You Cannot Do
- **Cannot** repackage this as a proprietary SaaS for "ethical giving."
- **Cannot** add a clause requiring attribution to "Lightning Path" in your fork (GPL allows removal of branding).
- **Cannot** sue us if the protocol fails. You inspect at your own risk.

## What You Must Do
- **Must** publish your fork's allocations, velocity, and burn if you distribute it.
- **Must** keep governance issues and audit calls public if you run a node.
- **Must** credit the source in your first commit message, then you're free to erase our name.

**This is a Gordian Knot. The license is the sword.**
